## Rules: 
No (direct) NSFW (indirect references are allowed)
No character-specific comics (for example, a comic focused on showcasing a character instead of making a joke.)
Must be okay with having comic appear on webserver ( open source: https://replit.com/@MeowcaTheoRange/XKCDify-Gallery ) with credit.
Original artwork must be YOURS.
Must agree to Creative Commons license Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 Generic according to original XKCD licensing standards. (only following the comic I've made out of yours. Your original comic can still have its' own license.) 
Don't submit "Patron-exclusive" comics - these usually have a non-derivative license applied onto them which means it's not okay to XKCD-ify, even if you are the original creator. I also don't have money to view these comics in case of a shortlink submission.
